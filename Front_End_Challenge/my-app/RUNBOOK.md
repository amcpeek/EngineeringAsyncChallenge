# Front End Challenge:

# Instructions:

* I ran the following command in the terminal to download the React for Typescript package:
* npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
## To Start:
* In the terminal:
* npm install
* npm start


# Notes:

- I chose to have one CSS file for the frontend, I find it similar to navigate
- For the blue hue of two of the photos, I did make it blue, but the black is still there
- I added a feature that after the user submits their contact information, the contact information prints in the console, and the page thanks them for filling out the form
- I was not able to find a font that has the g with the right top corner pointing out like that and the rest of the font in a matching style, so I kept it as the default font
- Since the "Register Now" button does not work, when the mouse goes over it is has a "NO" sign to indicate the button doesn't work intentionally
- I decided to not have the black lines on the outside of the page
- I gave the Current Coaches box a box-shadow instead of having it be a slightly different color then the surrounding white
- I wanted the text on the right of the sign up form to be smaller because if the inspect tools is up, which it would need to be for the console, I wanted it to not mess up for format
- The layout of the Hero image is a little off, but I decided it was close enough
